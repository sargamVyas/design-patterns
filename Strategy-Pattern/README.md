This contains the implementation for the Strategy design pattern

## Strategy Pattern:
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable.
It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Design Principle:
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interface, not implementations

## Example:
Create SimUDuck App that show large varieties of duck displaying different behaviours like swimming, quacking, flying etc.
