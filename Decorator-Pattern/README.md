This contains the implementation for the Decorator design pattern

## Decorator Pattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decoratos provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Design Principle:
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modifications.

## Example:
Create a starBuzz coffee where the client will be able to order beverage with their favorite condiments.
