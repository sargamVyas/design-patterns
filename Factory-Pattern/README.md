This contains the implementation for the Factory design pattern

## Factory Pattern:
Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method let a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

## Design Principle: 
The Dependency Inversion Principle guides us to avoid dependencies on concrete types and to strive for abstractions. 

## Example:
Create a Pizza shop where owner will be able to open different branches in various regions and create variety of pizzas based on region.
