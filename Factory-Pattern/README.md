This contains the implementation for the Factory design pattern

## Factory Pattern:
Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method let a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

## Design Principle: 
The Dependency Inversion Principle guides us to avoid dependencies on concrete types and to strive for abstractions. 

## Example:
In this example we are creating a Pizza shop which has different types of pizza that varies with different Regions.
